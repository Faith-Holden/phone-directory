# phone-directory

My solution for Chapter 10 Exercise 1 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.

Problem Description:
Rewrite the PhoneDirectory class from Subsection 7.4.2 so that it uses a TreeMap to store
directory entries, instead of an array. (Doing this was suggested in Subsection 10.3.1.)
You should also write a short program to test the class.
